Currently, listed below are the only features that make up this project, but you can add new features as you like to make this project a better one!

```

2. List record
3. Modify record
4. Delete record

```

The functions used in this project are simple and they basically manipulate file handling and data structures. So, I will only describe the gotoxy function used in this project. Try to understand how this functions works as you may want to use it or find it used in many other C mini projects.
